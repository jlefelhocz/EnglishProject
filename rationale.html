        <h5>Rationale</h5>
        <p>Our resource is an interactive text based game that builds the storyline according to user input. This game demonstrates how the environment affects Crake’s values, and furthermore, how Crake’s values affect his engagement with the environment. The game applies to the novel because it provides a deeper understanding of Crake’s motives. At the end our of game you receive a ”Crake” score which evaluates how closely your values and decisions align with Crake’s. The similarities between our own values and Crake’s values presented in the game suggest that Atwood’s dystopia is within the realm of possibility for our society given specific circumstances and developments.</p>
<p>A dystopia gravely changes a person’s values, and Atwood explores how Crake’s values arise from the pre-BlyssPluss dystopia in her novel, Oryx and Crake. Power mongering through biowarfare is an accepted facet of life. Largely accepted values in ethics, such as the sanctity of human life, become minor, dissonant opinions. While Crake gains significant amounts of scientific knowledge, he also gains access to mature content at an early age, and views the depravities of life as typical, and even boring. Nevertheless, Crake progresses throughout the novel to become the epicenter of scientific progress and societal change. He wields unparalleled power, and thus is an integral component to the transition between the dystopias. When game players see themselves in comparison to Crake, they can better understand how dystopias can develop.</p>
<p>Crake’s defining traits are narcissism, a lack of empathy and ethical concern, cynicality, and excessive self-interest. His narcissism is evident in the Crakers’ creation: “... but each with green eyes. Crake’s aesthetic” (Atwood 8). Crake endows these ‘perfect’ beings with green eyes in his own image, quite similar to biblical lore of God and the creation of mankind. The idiom “eyes are the windows to the soul” has important implications in this situation: Crake distills his soul in these “perfect” beings. His cynical disposition is obvious through his choice to ultimately add homo sapiens to the Extinctathon roster. In his eyes, nobody, not even himself, is worthy of inhabiting the Earth. He only leaves Jimmy, as he believes a shepherd is necessary to guide the new species. As a mirror of society’s “self-interest, Crake merges as the quintessential homo faber, making it unlikely that any kind of positive social change will happen directly through him” (Danette). Crake supposedly considers ‘all of the options’, but really only considers what he believes is valid. Naturally when he attains power, his use of it is not for the benefit of the collective, but for what he personally believes should be done. </p>
<p>Through our research of Crake’s traits, we can begin to understand the motive behind perplexing events in the novel. “Crake said once, ‘Would you kill someone you loved to spare them the pain?’” (Atwood 320). He asked this before killing Oryx- an extreme and confusing action. Through our research however, we know that Crake is a very self-absorbed person who lacks empathy. His extreme actions can be ‘sanctified’ when we consider that Crake probably thought he knew best, and asked Jimmy only for self-reflection, not for any particular validation. Furthermore, he likely lacked the empathetic concerns for Oryx’s life that might have otherwise deterred him. The inability to understand the viewpoints of others in conjunction with the belief that his interests supercede the interests of others led Crake to kill Oryx without consideration for her thoughts on the issue. Similarly, Crake seems to have no concern for the billions he has killed. HIs lack of empathy is again evident, but his genocide is also an act of narcissism because he believes his creations, the Crakers, deserve to live over everyone else. The final and perhaps most condemning result of his action’s is the agonizingly lonesome fate he forcibly resigns to Jimmy. Despite years of camaraderie and close friendship, Crake fails to consider the weight of his genocidal actions. He steals away his best friend’s lover, way of life, world, and even his sense of belonging, and escapes the consequences of these actions by killing himself.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Crake’s personality and technological advancement lead to the post-BlyssPluss dystopia. Crake’s personality allowed him to convince himself that his idea is perfect, and “society's non-reactions towards abuses of power and destructive practices” (Kroon) allowed his idea to become a reality. After reading an in-depth analysis of how their choices reflect Crake’s, the player will better understand how a dystopia can affect a person’s point of view, thoughts, and ultimately, decisions. Philippe van Nedervelde, a futurist and security expert with a specialization in existential risks, explains “that with advancing technology, there is ever less needed to destroy ever more...Large-scale destruction becomes ever more possible with ever fewer resources.” This article helps explain how technological advancements can lead to the formation of a dystopia. In fact, the article even claims that, “these technologies will be developed by either highly-funded and highly-motivated government agencies and corporations” which is exactly what happens in Atwood’s dystopia. It is also something that could easily happen in our society. People can easily abuse advanced technology to change the world. Crake did it. If the wrong person had a similar opportunity in our society, it is likely we could suffer a similar fate as Jimmy.</p>
	<p>Our research focused on enumerating Crake’s traits and examining how they are characteristic of dystopia. Our resource provides an interactive experience through which users are prompted to choose actions which reflect their values, which are then compared to Crake’s traits. This facilitates reflection on the user’s part about how they perceive Crake and his actions, and by extension due to Crake being a product of dystopian values, how they perceive the dystopian society. Ideally, players will use this information not only to recognize the possibility of dystopia in our world, but also to reflect on their values and beliefs in the broader scope of society. Hopefully, it will remind players to consider other perspectives before they make decisions that could affect others.</p>
